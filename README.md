# Ansible - vagrant box

This is a vagrant box with ansible provisioning. 
The provisioning is configurable with what you need and how you need it.

Side note: On a machine with windows vagrant will be setup using shell provisioning. The shell provisioning will then install ansible on your vagrant box,
and execute the ansible-provisioning on the box.
